# Stock-Price-Prediction-Using-LSTM
This project is made under AI course at my college. 
I have used Long-short-term-memory algorithm to predict the stock price of apple and the dataset was fetch from Yahoo finance library directly.
I have also use MinMax scaler normalization and Mean absolute error metrics for model evaluation.
